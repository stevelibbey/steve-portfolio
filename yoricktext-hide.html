                            <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                            <p>As generative AI tools entered creative writing, many optimized for speed and output at the expense of voice. Readers began reacting negatively not just to AI-generated prose, but to the suspicion that a piece might be machine-written. Writers lost trust in the tools and in the work they produced. The challenge was to design an AI system that assists without overwriting authorial intent or encouraging generic text.</p>

                            <h4>Key Design Decisions</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Designed the system around preservation of the writer's voice rather than text generation</li>
                                <li>Avoided default prompt-to-prose flows that encourage copy-paste authorship</li>
                                <li>Built the experience around structure, revision, and decision-making</li>
                                <li>Emphasized transparency and user control over "magic" outputs</li>
                                <li>Treated AI as a collaborator within a workspace, not an authority</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Technical Implementation</h4>
                            <p>Designed UX and system behavior in parallel, defining how context and state persist across a writing project. Built production frontend code to validate interaction models and collaborated closely with engineering on feasibility. Implementation details are intentionally private while core ideas remain in development.</p>
